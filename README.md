Swifty
======

Hacking through Swift
This project does not have any other purpose than exploring and playing with swift features.

This project contains:
- Some playground files, for demonstration purposes.
- A folder desmonstrating how to use a custom class/protocol written in Objective-C and used from a Swift Class
- A Framework demonstrating how to use a Swift class from Objective-C Code
- A Snippet Folder, containing useful Swift Snippets for Xcode
- A Helper Folder that will contain some Helper Classes, Methods and additions for faster Swifter development.
- An empty Xcode iOS project that will be used to provide example code & context for all of these resources.
- A pdf export of the keynote that will be showed at my local CocoaHeads session (Lille, France, June 6th, 2014)
